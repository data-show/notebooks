Summary: GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear total population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. GDP per capita is a good measurement of a country's standard of living, by describing how much citizens benefit from their country's economy. Small, rich countries and more developed industrial countries tend to have the highest per capita GDP. Data are in current U.S. dollars.

Summary: The Press Freedom Index, yearly produced by Reporters Without Borders is a ranking of 180 countries which attempts to represent the degree of freedom that journalists, media, and netizens have in each country. The index is calculated on a scale from 0 to 100, the higher a country's score, the more worrying the press situation is.

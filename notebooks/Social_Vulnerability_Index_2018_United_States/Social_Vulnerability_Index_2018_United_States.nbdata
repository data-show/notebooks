Summary: CDCâ€™s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a tool to spatially identify and socially vulnerable populations. The SVI uses U.S. Census variables that reflect at-risk populations to identify and map vulnerable areas. Information on the location and relative concentration of different types of social vulnerabilities in small geographic areas, such as census tracts can help emergency managers locate and plan for the specific needs of their communities, before, during, and after a disaster.
